Finding scene cuts: 
	1. taking the whole scene, and concatenating the adjacent scenes (if they are short to add context)
	2. if there is not much movement, but there is a lot of ssd, then likely scene cut

Looking at audio
	2. have a way to rank the peaks based on the closeness of peaks
	3. look at shape of peaks (kurtosis and skewness)
	4. new sound is introduced to the scene or not


Looking at motion:
	1. action and movement: every video must involve someone doing something
	2. 

Looking at the pretty ness of a frame:
	1. explosions, fire, sparks and noise (ever wondered why these always lead the news bulletins?) or the going away of explosions
	2. awe-inspiringly big things like landscapes
	3. amazingly small things that our eyes can't see - but also anything closeup in general
	4. human stories and emotion no matter how complex
	5. train deep neural network on flikr photos (https://www.flickr.com/explore/)

Looking at what is in the frame:
	1. demo.caffe.berkeley for imagenet categorization of images
